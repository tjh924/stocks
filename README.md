Applying Python programming to financial markets -- specifically the stock market.

The motivation behind creation of this repository is to accurately convey my (Python) programming proficiency in the context of financial markets. Studying physics has demanded from me high-level mathematical and problem solving skills, but in a largely academic, and seldom technical, environment. It is my hope is that the code contained in this repository (and others) demonstrates these same skills, but carried over into a computational setting.

This is also a way to consolidate all of the various pieces of code I've written over the past several months that relate to financial markets.
